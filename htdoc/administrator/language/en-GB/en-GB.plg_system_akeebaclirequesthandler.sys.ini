PLG_SYSTEM_AKEEBA_REQUESTHANDLER_XML_NAME="API Portal - Akeeba CLI Request Handler"
PLG_SYSTEM_AKEEBA_REQUESTHANDLER_XML_DESCRIPTION="Akeeba Remote CLI is a command-line based tool designed to generate backups of Joomla environments in an automated way. By design, this tool is a network client that requires a peer server WebApp (Akeeba Backup). The native Akeeba Backup security relies on a Secret Key.
The role of the present plug-in is to add additional security on top of this by whitelisting IP addresses from which Akeeba Remote CLI is allowed to connect to the Akeeba Backup WebApp.
By default, this plug-in is disabled. As soon as it is enabled, it is going to block connections from all incoming IP addresses except those entered in the input field below (separated by coma). An empty value blocks all incoming calls."
PLG_SYSTEM_AKEEBA_REQUESTHANDLER_XML_FIELD_DESC="Allowed IP Address(es). Add Ips addresses with coma(,) seperated."
